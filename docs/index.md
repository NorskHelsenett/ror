# Release Operate Report

ROR is a multi cluster management tool aimed to streamline the process of creating kubernetes clusters on any provider or architecture.
ROR is developed by Norsk Helsenett SF but we move to remove any references and internal logic related to the organization. Our aim is to release the project as an open source project.
