# Philosophy

## 1. API Driven

ROR is API first and any functionality is to be available through the API.

## 2. Provider agnostic but extensible

ROR is to be provider agnostic but extensible through microservices or operators to convert provider specific resources to generic ROR resources.

## 3. Start simple then extend

Support simple primitives first then extend support if needed.
Collect only needed data, scope the datamodel to suit our need.
